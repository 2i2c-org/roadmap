# 2i2c's Roadmap

> **WORK IN PROGRESS**
> This is a rough draft, so calibrate your expectations accordingly!

This repository serves as a way for 2i2c's team to share its priorities and interests for development with the broader community.

## Goals

- Transparency: Make our development interests and priorities more discoverable for our member communities, upstream communities, funders, and the outside world.
- Participation: Invite discussion, +1s, and collaboration on things we're interested in working on.
- Co-funding: Encourage communities to find things they'd like to support with financial resources or in-kind contributions.

## Where is 2i2c's roadmap?

Our roadmap is in two columns of the [P&S GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/2i2c-org/projects/57). Roadmap items are _initiatives_ that live in these two columns:

- Upcoming P&S initiatives - Initiatives we'd like to work on, roughly in priority order from top to bottom
- P&S Initiatives in flight - Initiatives that are currently driving work.

Initiatives labeled `[platform initiative]` are what we show here.

## Structure

- `scripts/` - Scripts to scrape the project board above for platform initiatives on our roadmap, and save them in a way that Jupyter Book can display.
- `docs/` - A Jupyter Book site that uses the output of `scripts/` to share roadmap items in a helpful way. It has a landing page that lists all of our roadmap items, and a dedicated page for each roadmap item that we can reference, with a link back to the GitHub issue.

## Workflow

This repository simply mirrors and re-packages items on our project board for easier visibility and reference. All of the content in this website is programmatically generated by a script that we run on a GitHub Workflow each day. It is hosted on a site on GitHub Pages.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [gh CLI](https://cli.github.com/) installed and authenticated
- [nox](https://nox.thea.codes/)
- Node.js 20+ (for MyST)

### Local Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -e .
pip install nox

# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login
```

### Commands

```bash
# Sync roadmap data from GitHub
nox -s sync

# Build documentation site
nox -s docs

# Run live preview server
nox -s docs-live

# Sync and build (what CI runs)
nox -s sync-and-docs
```

### How It Works

1. **Scraper script** (`scripts/sync_roadmap.py`) uses `gh` CLI to:
   - Fetch items from the P&S GitHub Project Board
   - Filter for platform initiatives in roadmap columns
   - Fetch full issue details for each initiative
   - Generate Markdown files in `docs/initiative/`
   - Generate index page in `docs/index.md`

2. **MyST** builds the static documentation site from the Markdown files

3. **GitHub Actions** runs daily to:
   - Sync latest data from project board
   - Build the MyST site
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages
   - Commit generated files back to the repo

### Testing

```bash
# Run tests
pytest
```
