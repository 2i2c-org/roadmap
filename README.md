# 2i2c's Roadmap

This website serves as a way for 2i2c's team to share its priorities, interests, and product activity with communities it collaborates with. Find the site here:

https://2i2c.org/roadmap

## Goals

- Transparency: Make our development interests and priorities more discoverable for our member communities, upstream communities, funders, and the outside world.
- Participation: Invite discussion, +1s, and collaboration on things we're interested in working on.
- Co-funding: Encourage communities to find things they'd like to support with financial resources or in-kind contributions.

## Where is 2i2c's roadmap?

Our roadmap is in two columns of the [P&S GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/2i2c-org/projects/57). Roadmap items are _initiatives_ that live in these two columns:

- Upcoming P&S initiatives - Initiatives we'd like to work on, roughly in priority order from top to bottom
- P&S Initiatives in flight - Initiatives that are currently driving work.

Initiatives labeled `[platform initiative]` are what we show here.

## Structure

- `docs/` - A Jupyter Book site that uses the output of `scripts/` to share roadmap items in a helpful way. It has a landing page that lists all of our roadmap items, and a dedicated page for each roadmap item that we can reference, with a link back to the GitHub issue.

## Workflow

This repository simply mirrors and re-packages items on our project board for easier visibility and reference. All of the content in this website is programmatically generated by a script that we run on a GitHub Workflow each day. It is hosted on a site on GitHub Pages.

A **GitHub Access Token** owned by `@choldgraf` authenticates the request to our GitHub Projects board.
