# 2i2c Platform Roadmap

The table below shows the platform initiatives in our near-term roadmap.
They are pulled from the [`2i2c-org/initiatives` repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/initiatives).
We invite you to comment on anything there!
See the [About the roadmap page](./about.md) for context on our workflow and funding model.

:::{important} This roadmap is constantly changing
:class: dropdown
Our roadmap is always changing based on feedback from our member communities.
The goal of this site is to make our roadmap process more **transparent**, **participatory**, and **useful** to drive conversations with our community members.

Things towards the top are closer to action, more well-refined, and more likely to happen. Things towards the bottom are more experimental or vague and need refinement.
