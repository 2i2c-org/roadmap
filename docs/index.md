# 2i2c Platform Roadmap

:::{important} This roadmap is subject to change at any time
:class: dropdown
This roadmap is automatically synced from our Product team project board. It is constantly changing based on funding, priorities, and community needs. The goal of this site is to make our roadmap process more **transparent**, **participatory**, and **useful** to align interests of our collaborators and member communities.

Things towards the top are closer to action, more well-refined, and more likely to happen. Things towards the bottom are more experimental or vague and need refinement.

**Last updated:** {today}` `
