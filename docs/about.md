# About the Roadmap

This roadmap reflects the current priorities of the [2i2c](https://2i2c.org) Product Team and is automatically synced from our [internal project board](https://github.com/orgs/2i2c-org/projects/57). It is constantly changing based on funding, priorities, and community needs.

## Our goals

We publish this roadmap to achieve three main goals:

- **Transparency**: Make our development interests and priorities discoverable for our member communities, upstream communities, funders, and the general public.
- **Participation**: Invite discussion, feedback, and collaboration on the initiatives we are exploring.
- **Co-funding**: Encourage communities to identify shared needs and support them with financial resources or in-kind contributions.

## Our Co-funding model

While some initiatives are supported by our core budget, many rely on **co-funding** from our member communities. This model allows us to prioritize work that has tangible, immediate value to our users and ensures our sustainability as a non-profit.

**If you'd like an initiative to be worked on sooner**, providing some (or all) of the funding needed is the best way to make it happen. Click the {kbd}`Co-fund this` button to fill out a form that will help us work with you to get the work funded.

## Our workflow

The items on this roadmap are **Initiatives** - these are projects or features that we believe will significantly improve the infrastructure our member communities use. We rely on our member communities to help us shape Initiatives and find funding for them.

Here's the lifecycle of initiatives - the further down the cycle they go, the more likely they'll be worked on soon.

1. **Identified**: We identify needs from our community support channels, upstream developments, and internal strategy.
2. **Scoped**: We define a Statement of Work (SOW) to understand the effort required.
3. **Funded**: We look for alignment with member communities who may be willing to "co-fund" the initiative.
4. **Execution**: Once funded (or prioritized via core budget), the work is scheduled and executed.
